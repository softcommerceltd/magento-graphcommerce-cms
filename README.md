# GraphCommerce headless CMS extension for Magento 2
The core purpose of this module is to provide integration of PageBuilder Content Management System for [GraphCommerceÂ® headless theme](https://www.graphcommerce.org/), eventually replacing original HyGraph with its own CMS.
This module extends PageBuilder's functionality by introducing custom components that are used for building page content.

## Features
- Build rich page content by using Magento's native PageBuilder;
- Create media assets that support both images, SVG and video formats;
- Both CMS Pages and Blocks are supported;
- Add your own custom PageBuilder components;

## Supported PageBuilder Components
- Use `cmsRowHeroBanner` component to build `RowHeroBanner` content as seen in demo;
- Use `cmsRowLinks` component to build `RowLinks` content;
- Use `cmsRowProduct` component to build `RowProduct` catalog with ability to specify products by either category, SKU or custom rules;
- Use `cmsRowSpecialBanner` component to build `RowSpecialBanner` content;
- Use `cmsRowQuote` component to build `RowQuote` rich text content;

## Supported PageBuilder Elements

- `gc-page-links` - used to provide links that support either a direct, product, category or CMS page URL;
